## code
This folder contains a Jupyter notebook developed using a Python 3 kernel that generates the figures and conducts the data analysis associated with the study. The notebook uses the Python packages listed in the environment.yml file in the folder. Users of conda can create an environment using that file in order to run the code with all of the necessary libraries.

## data
This folder contains new and compiled paleomagnetic, geochronologic and geochemistry data.

## manuscript
This folder contains the .tex source file and the compiled PDF of the manuscript associated with the study.
